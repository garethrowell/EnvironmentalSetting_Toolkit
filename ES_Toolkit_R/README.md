Tools supporting the NPS IMD Environmental Setting protocol.   

#### Overview ####

This package provides data access via ACIS web services (http://www.rcc-acis.org/docs_webservices.html) to station information and station data that:

+ Supports basic data request functions:

  * findStation
  * requestData

+ Formats outputs consistently:

  * Limits alteration to data returned from ACIS web services
  * Returns data frames or spatially referenced raster stacks
  
In addition, the package contains convenience functions for requesting Environmental Setting metrics, both the station-based metrics sourced from ACIS and the raster-based metrics sourced from 800m PRISM or climate indexes. 

The Environmental Setting Toolkit is the next iteration of and was forked from the IM_Climate toolkit created in 2016-2017. That toolkit can be found here: (https://github.com/IMDProjects/IM_Climate)
